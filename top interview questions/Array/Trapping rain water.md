**Code Explanation:**


**Initialization**


if (height == null || height.length <= 1) {
    return 0;
}


This checks if the input array height is null or has a length of 1 or less. If either condition is true, it returns 0 because no water can be trapped.


**Variable Declaration**


int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;
int water = 0;


left and right are pointers initialized to the start and end of the array, respectively.
leftMax and rightMax store the maximum heights encountered from the left and right sides.
water keeps track of the total amount of trapped water.


**Two-Pointer Approach**


while (left < right) {
    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
        if (height[left] >= leftMax) {
            leftMax = height[left];
        } else {
            water += leftMax - height[left];
        }
        left++;
    } else {
        if (height[right] >= rightMax) {
            rightMax = height[right];
        } else {
            water += rightMax - height[right];
        }
        right--;
    }
}


The while loop runs as long as left is less than right.
Inside the loop, it checks whether the height at the left pointer is less than the height at the right pointer.
If height[left] < height[right], it means the potential water trapped depends on the left side.
If height[left] is greater than or equal to leftMax to height[left].
Otherwise, calculate the trapped water at the current left position as leftMax - height[left] and add it to water.
Move the left pointer one step to the right.
If height[left] >= height[right], it means the potential water trapped depends on the right side.
If height[right] is greater than or equal to rightMax, update rightMax to height[right].
Otherwise, calculate the trapped water at the current right position as rightMax - height[right] and add it to water.
Move the right pointer one step to the left.
Return Result
return water;
Finally, return the total amount of trapped water.


**Summary**


This code uses a two-pointer approach to efficiently calculate the amount of water trapped between the heights in the array. By maintaining the maximum heights encountered from both sides and adjusting the pointers accordingly, it ensures that the trapped water is calculated in O(n) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.
